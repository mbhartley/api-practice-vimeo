api-practice-vimeo
==================

A practice repository working with the Vimeo API

This project was originally created during my front-end engineering course at The Iron Yard Academy. It was one
of my first attempts working with an API. The app, built on Backbone.js, connects the user to a specific Vimeo channel
called "NiceType" and simply requires the user to click on the call to action in order to load videos from the channel.

The greatest lesson I learned during the week API's were introduced is that API's suck :) My final assessment was
that someone would definitely make the world of front-end development a much better place if they would create and 
enforce universal standards for API's and their subsequent documentation.
